       "[\"Phoenix (constellation)\\nPhoenix is  a  minor  constellation  in  the  southern sky.  Named  after  the  mythical  phoenix,  it  was  first depicted on a celestial atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria . The French explorer and astronomer  Nicolas  Louis  de  Lacaille  charted  the brighter  stars  and  gave  their  Bayer  designations  in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly -39¡ to -57¡ declination, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of right ascension.  The  constellations  Phoenix,  Grus,  Pavo and Tucana, are known as the Southern Birds.\\nThe brightest star, Alpha Phoenicis, is named Ankaa, an  Arabic  word  meaning  'the  Phoenix'.  It  is  an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is Beta Phoenicis, actually a binary system composed of two yellow  giants  with  a  combined  apparent  magnitude of 3.3.  Nu  Phoenicis  has  a  dust  disk,  while  the constellation has ten star systems with known planets and the recently discovered galaxy clusters El Gordo and the Phoenix ClusterÑlocated 7.2 and 5.7 billion light years away  respectively,  two  of  the largest objects in the visible universe. Phoenix is the radiant of two annual meteor showers: the Phoenicids in December, and the July Phoenicids.\\n\\nHistory\\nPhoenix  was  the  largest  of  the  12  constellations established by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman.

[5]',\n",
       " 'Phoenix\\nCelestial  historian  Richard  Allen  noted  that  unlike  the other constellations introduced by Plancius and La Caille, Phoenix has actual precedent in ancient astronomy, as the Arabs saw this formation as representing young ostriches, Al  Ri\\' ā l ,  or  as  a  griffin  or  eagle. [6] In  addition,  the  same group of stars was sometimes imagined by the Arabs as a boat, Al Zaurak , on  the  nearby  river  Eridanus. [7] He observed,  \"the  introduction  of  a  Phoenix  into  modern astronomy was, in a measure, by adoption rather than by invention.\" [6]\\nThe Chinese incorporated Phoenix\\'s brightest star, Ankaa (Alpha Phoenicis), and stars from the adjacent  constellation  Sculptor  to  depict Bakui , a  net  for  catching  birds. [4] Phoenix  and  the neighbouring constellation of Grus together were seen by Julius Schiller as portraying Aaron the High  Priest. [6] These  two  constellations,  along  with  nearby  Pavo  and  Tucana,  are  called  the Southern Birds. [8]',\n",
       " 'Characteristics\\nPhoenix is a small constellation bordered by Fornax and Sculptor to the north, Grus to the west, Tucana to the south, touching on the corner of Hydrus to the south, and Eridanus to the east and southeast. The bright star Achernar is nearby. [9]  The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is \"Phe\". [10]  The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer EugGLYPH<143>ne Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 23 h   26.5 m   and  02 h   25.0 m   ,  while  the  declination  coordinates  are  between -39.31¡  and -57.84¡. [1] This means it remains below the horizon to anyone living north of the 40th parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and remains low in the sky for anyone living north of the equator. It is most visible from locations such as Australia and South Africa during late Southern Hemisphere spring. [7] Most  of  the  constellation  lies  within,  and  can  be  located  by,  forming  a  triangle  of  the bright stars Achernar, Fomalhaut and Beta CetiÑAnkaa lies roughly in the centre of this. [11]',\n",
       " 'Stars\\nA curved line of stars comprising Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Beta, Nu and Gamma Phoenicis was seen as a boat  by  the  ancient  Arabs. [6] French  explorer  and  astronomer  Nicolas  Louis  de  Lacaille  charted and designated 27 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Omega in 1756. Of these, he labelled  two  stars  close  together  Lambda,  and  assigned  Omicron,  Psi  and  Omega  to  three  stars, which subsequent astronomers such as Benjamin Gould felt were too dim to warrant their letters. A different star was subsequently labelled Psi Phoenicis, while the other two designations fell out of use. [12]\\nAnkaa is the brightest star in the constellation. It is an orange giant of apparent visual magnitude 2.37 and spectral type K0.5IIIb, [13]  77 light years distant from Earth and orbited by a secondary object about which little is known. [14]  Lying close by Ankaa is Kappa Phoenicis, a main sequence star of spectral type A5IVn and apparent magnitude 3.90. [15]  Located centrally in the asterism, [7] Beta Phoenicis is the second brightest star in the constellation and another binary star. Together',\n",
       " 'Stars\\nthe  stars,  both  yellow  giants  of  spectral  type  G8,  shine with an apparent magnitude of 3.31, though the components are of individual apparent magnitudes of 4.0 and  4.1  and  orbit  each  other  every  168  years. [16] Zeta Phoenicis or Wurren [17] is  an Algol-type eclipsing binary, with an apparent magnitude fluctuating between 3.9 and 4.4  with  a  period  of  around  1.7  days  (40  hours);  its dimming  results  from  the  component  two  blue-white  Btype  stars,  which  orbit  and  block  out  each  other  from Earth. The two stars are 0.05 AU from each other, while a third star is around 600 AU away from the pair, and has an orbital period exceeding 5000 years. [18]  The system is around  300  light  years  distant. [19] In  1976,  researchers Clausen,  Gyldenkerne,  and  Gr¿nbech  calculated  that  a nearby  8th  magnitude  star  is  a  fourth  member  of  the system. [20]',\n",
       " 'Stars\\nAI  Phe  is  an  eclipsing  binary  star  identified  in  1972.  Its long  mutual  eclipses  and  combination  of  spectroscopic and  astrometric  data  allows  precise  measurement  of  the masses  and  radii  of  the  stars [21] which  is  viewed  as  a potential  cross-check  on  stellar  properties  and  distances independent  on  Ceiphid  Variables  and  such  techniques. The long eclipse events require space-based observations to  avoid  Solar  interference.  Gamma  Phoenicis  is  a  red giant of spectral type M0IIIa [22] and  varies  between magnitudes 3.39 and 3.49. It lies 235 light years away. [23] Psi  Phoenicis  is  another  red  giant,  this  time  of  spectral type M4III, [24] and  has  an  apparent  magnitude  that ranges  between  4.3  and  4.5  over  a  period  of  around  30 days. [25] Lying 340 light years away, [24]  it has around 85 times the diameter, but only 85% of the mass, of the Sun. [26] W  Phoenicis is a Mira variable, ranging from magnitude  8.1  to  14.4  over  333.95  days.  A  red  giant,  its spectrum  ranges  between  M5e  and  M6e. [27]   Located  6.5 degrees  west  of  Ankaa  is  SX  Phoenicis,  a  variable  star which ranges from magnitude 7.1 to 7.5 over a period of a mere 79 minutes. Its spectral type varies between A2 and',\n",
       " \"Stars\\nF4. [28] It  gives  its  name  to  a  group  of  stars  known  as  SX  Phoenicis  variables. [29] Rho  and  BD Phoenicis are Delta Scuti variablesÑshort period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been\\nused as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. [30]  Rho is spectral type F2III, [31] and ranges between magnitudes 5.20 and 5.26 over a period of 2.85 hours. [32]  BD is of spectral type A1V, [33] and ranges between magnitudes 5.90 and 5.94. [34]\\nNu Phoenicis is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96. [35] Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as the Sun, [36]  and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. [37]  It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. [25]  Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. [38]  White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. [39]  With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 10 8.39 ± 0.01 (2.45 á 10 8 ) cmás -2 , or approximately 250,000 of Earth's. [40]\",\n",
       " 'Stars\\nTen  stars  have  been  found  to  have  planets  to  date,  and  four  planetary  systems  have  been discovered with the SuperWASP project. HD 142 is a yellow giant that has an apparent magnitude of 5.7, and has a planet (HD 142 b) 1.36 times the mass of Jupiter which orbits every 328 days. [41] HD 2039 is a yellow  subgiant  with  an  apparent  magnitude  of  9.0  around  330  light  years  away which has a planet (HD 2039 b) six times the mass of Jupiter. WASP-18 is a star of magnitude 9.29 which was discovered to have a hot Jupiter-like planet (WASP-18b) taking less than a day to orbit the star. [42] The  planet  is  suspected  to  be  causing  WASP-18  to  appear  older  than  it  really  is. [43] WASP-4  and  WASP-5  are  solar-type  yellow  stars  around  1000  light  years  distant  and  of  13th magnitude,  each  with  a  single  planet  larger  than  Jupiter. [44] WASP-29  is  an  orange  dwarf  of spectral type K4V and visual magnitude 11.3, which has a planetary companion of similar size and mass to Saturn. The planet completes an orbit every 3.9 days. [45]',\n",
       " 'Stars\\nWISE J003231.09-494651.4 and WISE J001505.87-461517.6 are two brown dwarfs discovered by the  Wide-field  Infrared  Survey  Explorer,  and  are  63  and  49  light  years  away  respectively. [46] Initially  hypothesised  before  they  were  belatedly  discovered, [47] brown  dwarfs  are  objects  more massive than planets, but which are of insufficient mass for hydrogen fusion characteristic of stars to occur. Many are being found by sky surveys. [48]\\nPhoenix  contains  HE0107-5240,  possibly  one  of  the  oldest  stars  yet  discovered.  It  has  around 1/200,000 the metallicity that the Sun has and hence must have formed very early in the history of the universe. [49] With a visual magnitude of 15.17, [50]  it is around 10,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye and is 36,000 light years distant. [49]',\n",
       " \"Deep-sky objects\\nThe constellation does not lie on the galactic plane of the Milky Way, and there are no prominent star  clusters. [9] NGC 625 is a dwarf irregular galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.0 and lying some 12.7 million light years distant. Only 24000 light years in diameter, it is an outlying member of the Sculptor Group. NGC 625 is thought to have been involved in a collision and is experiencing a burst\\nof  active  star  formation. [51] NGC  37  is  a  lenticular  galaxy  of  apparent  magnitude  14.66.  It  is approximately 42 kiloparsecs (137,000 light-years) in diameter and about 12.9 billion years old. [52] Robert's Quartet (composed of the irregular galaxy NGC 87, and three spiral galaxies NGC 88, NGC 89 and NGC 92) is a group of four galaxies located around 160 million light-years away which are in  the  process  of  colliding  and  merging.  They  are  within  a  circle  of  radius  of  1.6  arcmin, corresponding  to  about  75,000  light-years. [53]   Located  in  the  galaxy  ESO  243-49  is  HLX-1,  an intermediate-mass black holeÑthe first one of its kind identified. It is thought to be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed in a collision with ESO 243-49. Before its discovery, this class of black hole was only hypothesized. [54]\",\n",
       " 'Deep-sky objects\\nLying within the bounds of the constellation is the gigantic Phoenix cluster, which is around 7.3 million light years wide and 5.7 billion light years away, making it one of the most massive galaxy clusters. It was first discovered in 2010, and the central galaxy is producing an estimated 740 new stars  a  year. [55] Larger  still  is  El  Gordo,  or  officially  ACT-CL  J0102-4915,  whose  discovery  was announced  in  2012. [56]   Located  around  7.2  billion  light  years  away,  it  is  composed  of  two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of hot gas, seen in X-rays and infrared images. [57]\\n\\nMeteor showers\\nPhoenix is the radiant of two annual meteor showers. The Phoenicids, also known as the December Phoenicids,  were  first  observed  on  3  December  1887.  The  shower  was  particularly  intense  in December 1956, and is thought related to the breakup of the short-period comet 289P/Blanpain. It peaks around 4Ð5 December, though is not seen every year. [58]  A very minor meteor shower peaks around July 14 with around one meteor an hour, though meteors can be seen anytime from July 3 to 18; this shower is referred to as the July Phoenicids.
